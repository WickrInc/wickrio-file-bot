# WickrIO File Bot

Wickr provides a sample integration that allows storing, removal and retrieval of files by a Wickr IO bot. Wickr users on the same network as the Wickr FileBot can interact with the bot to share files with each other.

To get started, you would need to setup your system, download and install Docker and run the WickrIO Docker container. Full instructions on how to do so are available here: https://wickrinc.github.io/wickrio-docs/#wickr-io-getting-started

* /help@botName - List all available commands
